# ChefRisingStar

Project Definition
===================
Chef Rising Star! Partnering with Tablee des Chefs, a non profit situated in Montreal Canada we devised a solution that helps users of the App learn more about cooking and the ingredients that go into recipes.
Chef Rising Star encourages you to make dietary changes by giving you achievements and linking to your social media accounts to post your results. It makes substitution decisions easy by suggesting alternatives and showing you the differences in C02 emissions, Land use, water use, transportation costs, packaging and general waste produced when growing that food item. It does this by showing you an easy to read diagram where a smaller ecological footprint is better. Chef Rising Star can help everyone not only learn the skills required to cook at home but become more sustainable by doing so.
